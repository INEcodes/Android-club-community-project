# üåç Natural Language Processing - Language Guesser

This repository contains the code and resources for a community machine learning project focused on **Language Identification**. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of guessing or identifying the language of a given text input.

This project was developed on the topic of Machine Learning with assistance and collaboration from the **Android Club of our University**.

***

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Language Identification Model:** A machine learning model, likely implemented using NLP techniques, to predict the language of text.
* **Python Implementation:** The core logic is built entirely in Python, leveraging common data science and ML libraries.
* **Training Dataset Included:** A dedicated training file (`final_train.csv`) is provided for reproducing or extending the model.

***

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally and run the language guesser model.

### Prerequisites

You will need Python 3.x installed. It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# .\venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows (PowerShell)
````

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/INEcodes/Android-club-community-project.git](https://github.com/INEcodes/Android-club-community-project.git)
    cd Android-club-community-project
    ```

2.  Install the necessary dependencies. Since this is a machine learning project, essential libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and possibly `numpy` and `nltk` are required.

    *A standard ML requirements file (e.g., `requirements.txt`) should be created for full dependency management. Assuming basic ML stack:*

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
    ```

### Execution

The core logic of the model is contained in `Final Code.py`.

To run the model (e.g., to train it or make predictions):

```bash
python "Final Code.py"
```

You can open the Python file to see the implementation details, including data loading from `final_train.csv` and the machine learning algorithm used.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is straightforward and contains the essential files for the project:

```
Android-club-community-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Final Code.py           # The main Python script containing the ML model and logic.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ final_train.csv         # The dataset used for training the language identification model.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md               # This README file.
```
